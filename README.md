VOI Mobile Application


Inspiration
Theme:
Smart Law Enforcement. The idea behind the VOI (Vehicle of Interest) mobile application is to enhance field officers’ ability to quickly identify and manage vehicles that pose a potential threat, such as those linked to Amber Alerts, stolen vehicle reports, or outstanding warrants. Our application aims to support law enforcement by delivering critical vehicle data in real-time, improving the safety and efficiency of operations.

What it does
The VOI mobile application enables officers to search and retrieve information on vehicles flagged for various reasons, such as high-priority alerts or suspicious activity. For example, if an officer encounters a vehicle matching a flagged description, they can use the app to quickly look up the vehicle’s status by entering the license plate, make, or model. The app displays relevant details, such as alert type, owner information, and vehicle history. Additionally, the app provides real-time alerts for new high-priority vehicles, ensuring officers are always informed of current risks in their area. This functionality empowers officers to make timely decisions, increasing public safety and enabling effective response to potential incidents.

How We Built It
The VOI mobile application was developed using a combination of NetBeans IDE for development, HTML5 and JavaScript for interface design, and Java DB (Derby) for database management. The backend is connected to Maryland State Police databases, providing seamless integration and real-time data updates. The application is designed to be cross-platform, supporting both iOS and Android devices to ensure flexibility and accessibility in the field.

Challenges We Ran Into
Developing a secure and efficient data integration system to handle sensitive information was a challenge. Additionally, creating an interface that’s intuitive enough for high-stress scenarios, yet comprehensive in its features, required careful design and testing. Ensuring the application functions smoothly in low-bandwidth environments, often encountered in remote field locations, also posed a technical challenge.

Accomplishments that We're Proud Of
We are proud to have built a functional prototype of the VOI mobile application that addresses real-world law enforcement needs. The application’s integration with external law enforcement databases and real-time alert system enables a highly responsive tool that we believe can significantly improve officer safety and operational efficiency. We’re particularly proud of the user interface, which provides complex data in a clear and accessible format for officers in the field.

What We Learned
Through this project, we learned about the importance of security and user experience in developing applications for law enforcement. Balancing simplicity in the user interface with robust data features was essential. We also learned the value of building an app that can handle various levels of connectivity, ensuring that officers can access critical information even in challenging network environments.

What's Next for the VOI Mobile Application
Future enhancements for the VOI application include expanding the integration with other state and federal databases, allowing for a more comprehensive view of flagged vehicles across jurisdictions. We also aim to add a geofencing feature that provides alerts based on proximity to flagged vehicles. Additionally, we plan to incorporate machine learning algorithms to analyze alert trends and predict potential vehicle-related risks, further enhancing proactive law enforcement capabilities.
